## How to deploy on Heroku

1. 

# Common debugging 
 
1. Run 'bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux'. Heroku runs on linux. When adding this into your Gemlock it allows Heroku to use your code.
2. Run 'bundle lock --add-platform ruby' 
3. Push changes

## How to install and run
<br>

### Project Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/dominicmeddick/acebook-smokin-meats.git
$ bundle install
$ bin/rails db:create
$ bin/rails db:migrate

```
### Run App
Deployed on: https://acebook-smokin-meats.herokuapp.com/

and hosted locally on localhost:3000
```
$ rails server
```

### Run Tests
```
$ rspec
```

### Troubleshooting

If you don't have Node.js installed, you might run into this error when running rspec:

```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable:
  Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/rails/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
 ```

Rails requires a Javascript runtime to work. The easiest way is to install Node by running `brew install node` - and then run `bundle exec rspec` again
